    With the current situation of the age of drug use starting to get younger rapidly, we decided to create a web platform where
    people can learn more about the harmful effects of drugs, and take quizzes to assess an individual's risk of drug use.
    In addition, our platform also provides users with free courses on drug use prevention, opportunities to meet and chat
    with experts to answer questions surrounding drug use.
